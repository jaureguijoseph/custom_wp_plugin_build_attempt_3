## Configuration Examples

### API Health Configuration
```php
const API_HEALTH_CONFIG = [
    'monitoring' => [
        'check_interval' => 300, // 5 minutes
        'timeout' => 30,
        'alert_threshold' => 3, // Failed attempts before alert
    ],
    'services' => [
        'plaid' => [
            'endpoints' => ['link', 'identity', 'payment'],
            'alert_email' => 'alerts@example.com',
        ],
        'authorize_net' => [
            'endpoints' => ['payment', 'webhook'],
            'alert_slack' => 'webhook_url',
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Role Management Configuration
```php
const ROLE_CONFIG = [
    'expiration' => [
        'timeout' => 1800, // 30 minutes
        'grace_period' => 300, // 5 minutes
    ],
    'transitions' => [
        'logging' => true,
        'validation' => true,
        'cleanup' => true,
